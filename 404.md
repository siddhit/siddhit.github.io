#Lost?#

At some point or another, we all usually are. Here's a quote to help you get home.

> Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached!

By Hindu monk and social reformer, [Swami Vivekanada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda), commenting on not just the state of his own religion but general apathy and cynicism all over society.

Want to dig deeper? The quote was itself an adaptaion from a verse in the [Katha Upanishad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katha_Upanishad)


>Uttisthata Jagrata Prapya Varannibodhata
>Kshurasanna Dhara Nishita Durataya
>durgama Pathah tat kavayo Vadanti

which means,
*Arise! Awake! Approach the great and learn.*
*Like the sharp edge of a razor is that path,*
*so the wise say—hard to tread and difficult to cross.*

<p>We all usually are. Here's an inspiring quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Arise, awake and stop not til the goal is reached!"</em></p>

<p>Go back <a href="/index.html">home</a> or if you found that interesting, here is the quote he referenced when saying it: the Katha Upanishad, a tale about a young boy, Nachiketa, who goes to the Yama, the Lord of Death himself to know the nature of humanity, knowledge, self and liberation.</p>

<p><em>Uttisthata Jagrata Prapya Varannibodhata</em></p>
<p><em>Kshurasanna Dhara Nishita Durataya </em></p>
<p><em>durgama Pathah tat kavayo Vadanti</em></p>

<p>whose English translation is:</p>
<p><em>Arise! Awake! Approach the great and learn.</em></p> 
    <p><em></em>Like the sharp edge of a razor is that path,</em></p>
        <p><em>so the wise say—hard to tread and difficult to cross.</em></p> -->
