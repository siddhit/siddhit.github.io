I"<p>While working to set up <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> at my new job, I had to create ‘spaces’– documents with content about our team, projects and so on. Around the same time, as a new PM and in true <a href="https://www.bringthedonuts.com/donuts/">Ken Norton style</a>, I sent out a box of donuts to my new office colleagues when I started this role and I found that a shop local to them (<a href="https://dynamodonut.com/">Dynamo Donuts</a>, in San Francisco, CA, USA) I selected had ‘divisive’ flavors. They were quite unique but I could see how they would have extreme reactions. So, rather than make a test page with just ‘alskdjfa;ds’ or ‘loren ipsum’, I thought, why not expand on an interesting topic of how even a donut shop recommendation could be divisive? By the end, I’d have a test page using Confluence features and I’ll be 0.0001% better at understanding and writing. Maybe.</p>

<p>What is it about food, of all things, that would make it so divisive? Divisiveness lends itself to cults, religious sects (not even the original religion). And I would start there because it tends to affect the entirety of someone’s life choices. But now, we’re divisive over completely frivolous things, like sodas, cars and mobile phones. What is strange about their longevity is basically that they’re about the means versus the end. How you reach God, which OS you use, and who will lead you somewhere. Journey vs. destination. After a point, you grow up and think, all I need is a phone that gets things done.</p>

<p>But food? It’s singularly about the journey, about the means. The destination is the invisible, humble stomach. That muscular pouch tirelessly creating a blend of salivated food and acid, not really a sight to behold even though that’s when the food is actually useful. With plated, culinary grade food, it’s all about the means - the tongue, the palate, the chew, the whiff and the sight. Maybe that’s why it’s so divisive. The destination isn’t even important, in our minds, that is. In reality, it causes all diseases of excess, but let’s not go there now.</p>

<p>For the novice author of this post, except for dessert (like donuts), I’m not a diehard foodie. But still, because it’s food, I am tempted to give in to the sects and cults. Peanut butter? Yum. Bananas? Yum. Peanut butter with bananas? Meh. It’s just indifference, no worries. But behold! When I read more of the menu items on Dynamo’s page I found - rose! One of my childhood favorites! Aargh - but rose on chocolate? Rose? Rose is a wonderful, traditional Indian flavor, reserved mostly for delicious, sweet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDrbexsYB-A">gulkand</a>. It works wonderfully with <a href="https://rakskitchen.net/sweet-paan-recipe-meetha-paan-preparation/">paan</a>, with other dessert like <a href="https://www.jcookingodyssey.com/2018/10/20/badam-gulkand-katli/">kaju katri</a>, and most magically, gulkand ice cream (if you can pull it off). But chocolate? No! Those two making this journey into my stomach past my judging tongue are itself wrongly paired. I will not stand for this!</p>

<p>Aah! You see this? This is what makes food divisive. When the means itself are in question. When the means or journey is tied to your memories and physical senses, not so much your ideologies or methods or tools. It’s more visceral. When you don’t even get to talk about the destination because this journey cannot start. Rose + chocolate = no go. Oh my, I wonder how bad this is for hardcore foodies.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I made a good placeholder Confluence document but I did clear my own thoughts about food. And I ordered from <a href="https://www.johnnydoughnuts.com/">Johnny’s Doughnuts</a> (yes, that’s the original spelling) which was great and .. conventional! So consider this post a tribute to all of our cherished comfort foods and their smells and tastes and memories and for whose fatty, sweet goodness we’d go to war with friends.</p>

<p>Bon appétit!</p>
