I"Á<p>While working to set up <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> at my new job, I had to create â€˜spacesâ€™â€“ documents with content about our team, projects and so on. Around the same time, as a new PM and in true <a href="https://www.bringthedonuts.com/donuts/">Ken Norton style</a>, I sent out a box of donuts to my new office colleagues when I started this role and I found that a shop local to them (<a href="https://dynamodonut.com/">Dynamo Donuts</a>, in San Francisco, CA, USA) I selected had â€˜divisiveâ€™ flavors. They were quite unique but I could see how they would have extreme reactions. So, rather than make a test page with just â€˜alskdjfa;dsâ€™ or â€˜loren ipsumâ€™, I thought, why not expand on an interesting topic of how even a donut shop recommendation could be divisive? By the end, Iâ€™d have a test page using Confluence features and Iâ€™ll be 0.0001% better at understanding and writing. Maybe.</p>
