I"a<p>While working to set up <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> at my job, I had to create ‘spaces’– documents with content about our team, projects and so on. At around the same time, I sent out a box of donuts to my new office colleagues when I started this role and I found that a shop local to them (<a href="https://dynamodonut.com/">Dynamo Donuts</a>, in San Francisco, CA, USA) I selected had ‘divisive’ flavors. They were quite unique but I could see how they would have extreme reactions. So, rather than make a test page with just ‘alskdjfa;ds’ or ‘loren ipsum’, I thought, why not expand on an interesting topic of how even a donut shop recommendation could be divisive? By the end, I’d have a test page using Confluence features and I’ll be 0.0001% better at understanding and writing. Maybe.</p>
