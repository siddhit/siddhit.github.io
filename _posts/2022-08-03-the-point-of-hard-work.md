Why is this still a question every young person has?

It might be because as a teenager is thrusted into the world by her parents, she observes for the first time different levels of work ethic in business and truly understandsn the direct commercial impacts on her paycheck. No doubt this is also observed in school when she was younger but now she might be on her own and you don't work just because your parents ask you to (as presumably children usually do for school) - you do it for cash. So our teenager starts working hard because she wants cash, like any of her age group.

After a few weeks and paychecks, she realizes that in entry level jobs requiring lots of energy and time and little judgement and accountability some people slack off quite a lot. Inevitably, this frustrates her because if you aren't as hard working, the pay is still the same, there's no praise but there also isn't any soreness of body. After all, working the fryer at that fast food place is no joke. When she talks about this with parents or friends or someone (presumably) older, she's taught the 'value of hard work' and how she 'has it easy' compared to their own glorius golden days. It's a tradition in which one generation calls the next one lazy simply because the need for back-breaking, mind-numbing hard work has gone down drastically due to technological progress. When I was in a Ford plant, I was told the ergonomics on that tranmission line were so much better than on the older body lines where employees often had long term health effects and my role was easy. The line I worked was also new and had more automation, and that was key. Automation eliminates a lot of what a previous generation calls 'hard work' even though it is their own generation that imagined, conceptualized or desired it in the first place.

But there are other types of hard work. In the case of running businesses, there is something similar happening. In the excellent book, [The E-Myth Revisited](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RO9VJK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), author Michael Gerber talks about 'working on the business, not in it' and the example of a baker turned frustrated entreprenuer is used. The baker works hard to start her own bakery and after a few months all that she likes about baking is gone and instead she has to grudgingly put in hours doing payroll, maintenance, taxes and hiring. She's working hard but not getting anywhere. What Gerber advises may not be applicable to futurstic startups that need a founder's always-present-conviction or super-niche businesses (like say nuclear reactor components) but it can be readily applied to a bakery, franchise or any business providing conventional products and services. The idea is that it may look like you're working less 'in' your business but that's only so you work 'more' on more businesses. Grow from one bakery to five and that won't be slacking off. You won't be baking, doing payroll or hiring which you think were 'real hard work' because you will have branch managers but you will be hiring those rare, brilliant managers, scouting perfect locations, acquiring private equity investment, launching a new line of product and so on, which you can't if you're busy wakin gup at six in the morning to bake the best cake ever.

Coming back to our bright-eyed teenager, the right answer to a question like, "why do I need to work hard if XYZ isn't" or "it doesn't get me anywhere" could be as follows: the hard work of say cleaning the fryers (or the baking oven) will teach you the work ethic needed to efficiently run a restaurant or bakery and allow you to empathize with your future employees but yes, it won't 'get you anywhere'. But the whole purpose of a hundred hours of doing this is that when a manager sees you work like that, you'll get that one opportunity to manage the whole branch or some other recruiter who wants to hire you for a customer service job because you were extra careful with his order. That will allow you to work in roles where there will be a shift from fryer cleaning to sale closing work. It will shift from physical work to judgement work. And that's really it. That is the sole purpose of those gruelling hours of raw, physical hard work -- to get more shots at opportunities where you can work 'on' things rather than 'in' things. Hard work is an ethic but one that is a means to an end, nothing more and nothing less. If someone got high up without any hard work, it means they landed an opportunity early but with a lesser work ethic they will not have as many shots at the next opportunity but our teenager, now say a leasing agent at a rental property firm, will remember her fryer days, work hard at more customer tours and lease closings and eventually get a shot at being a general partner in a construction venture, who knows. 

If reading this changed your mind, I'm glad! But if you discovered this on your own early enough, well, that's ideal.
