Why is this still a question every young person has?

It might be because as a teenager is thrusted into the world by her parents, she observes for the first time different levels of work ethic. No doubt this is also observed in school when she was younger but now she might be on her own and you don't work just because your parents ask you to. So she starts working hard because she wants cash, like any teenager.

When she starts working, she realizes, especially in entry level jobs which require lots of energy and time and little judgement or accountability that some people are slack more than she does and others work much harder than she does. Inevitably, she realizes the pay is the same, the praise is slightly less but the soreness of body and frustration is a lot less if you slack just that little bit. When she talks about this with parents or friends or someone (presumably) older, she's taugh the 'value of hard work' and how she 'has it easy'. It's a tradition of one generation to call the next one lazy simply because the need for raw, physical hard work has gone down drastically. When I was in a Ford plant, I was told the ergonomics on that tranmission line was so much better than on the older body lines where employees often had long term health effects. The line I worked was also new and had more automation, and that was key. Automation eliminates a lot of what a previous generation calls 'hard work' even though it is their own generation that imagined, conceptualized or desired it in the first place.

But there are other types of hard work. Those are under attack too. In the case of businesses, the excellent book, [The E-Myth Revisited](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RO9VJK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), author Michael Gerber talks about 'working on the business, not in it' and the example of a baker turned frustrated entreprenuer is used. The baker works hard and all that she likes about baking is gone and has to instead put in hours doing payroll, maintenance, taxes and hiring. She's working hard but not getting anywhere. What Gerber advises may not be applicable to futurstic startups that need a founder's always-present-conviction or super-niche businesses (like say nuclear reactor components) but it can be readily applied to a bakery, franchises or any business providing conventional products and services. The idea is that it may look like you're working less 'in' your business but that's only so you work 'more' on more businesses. Grow from one bakery to five and that won't be slacking off. You won't be baking, doing payroll or hiring because you have branch managers but you will be hiring those talented managers, scouting locations, acquiring private equity investment, launching a new line of product and so on, which you can't if you're busy baking the best cake ever.

Coming back to our bright-eyed teenager, the right answer to a question like, "why do I need to work hard if XYZ isn't" or "it doesn't get me anywhere" could be as follows: the hard work of say cleaning the fryers will teach you the work ethic needed to efficiently run this restaurant and allow you to empathize with your future employees but yes, it wont' 'get you anywhere'. But the whole purpose of a hundred hours of doing this in that when a manager sees you work like that, you'll get that one opportunity to manage the whole branch or some other recruiter who wants to hire you for a customer service job hires you because you were extra careful with his order. That will allow you to work in roles where there will be a shift from fryer cleaning to sale closing work. It will shift from physical work to judgement work. And that's really it. That is the sole purpose of those gruelling hours of raw, physical hard work -- to get more shots at opportunities where you can work 'on' things rather than 'in' things. Hard work is an ethic but one that is a means to an end, nothing more and nothing less. If someone got high up without any hard work, it means they landed an opportunity early but with a lesser work ethic, they will not have as many shots at the next opportunity but our teenager, now a leasing agent at a rental property firm, will remember her fryer days, work hard at more customer tours and calls and eventually get a shot at being a general partner in a construction venture, who knows.
