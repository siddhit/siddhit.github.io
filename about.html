<h2>Hi, I'm Siddhit.</h2>
<p><em>Hi, I'm Siddhit.</em> Welcome! I built this website to learn web development and to share my professional and personal interests.</p>

<div class="build-show" id="build-show" style="display: block;">
  <p>I am fascinated by technology that improves the offline, physical and built worlds and seek opportunities to build
    products and teams in those spaces. I've worked in the manufacturing, jewelry, automotive and real estate industries
    and think software and automation can greatly improve how they operate and produce.
  <p>

  <p>To just see my resume and connect, head over to my <a class='linkedin' target="_blank"
      href="https://linkedin.com/in/SiddhitSanghavi">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

  <p>I am currently Product Manager at <a class='fyusion' target="_blank" href="https://fyusion.com">Fyusion</a>, a
    startup increasing trust and transparency in the physical products trading space with superpowered 3D imaging
    enabled by AI
    technology. Fyusion was acquired by Cox Automotive in 2021. As a result, this currently includes deploying the
    technology in condition reporting of used cars in wholesale markets but a lot more value can be added all along the
    value chain and I'm excited to be a part of it.</p>

  <p>
    By training, I'm an industrial engineer (<a class="vt" target="none" href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech, go
      Hokies!</a>) and started my career in the US in manufacturing. I learned about vast, complex projects building
    production lines at <a class="ford-co" href="https://ford.com">Ford Motor Company</a> as an assembly engineer and
    after a project automating some assembly documents, my interest in code led me to Ford's analytics division as a
    data
    engineer and product owner creating and managing big data products from factory applications. Around the same time I
    participated in an internal
    Design Thinking workshop aimed at 'intrapreneurship' and with my friend, we proposed a solution to digitize on-site
    production line readiness tasks. Our team led the end-to-end development of a web-app MVP which we successfully
    tested at a Mustang production line launch in an Agile fashion and was taken over by the wider company IT team. This
    made me think more about product management as a primary role.
  </p>

  <p>After my 6 year stint at Ford, I joined <a class="pashi" target="_blank" href="https://pashi.com">Pashi</a>, a Y
    Combinator
    startup that made SaaS for factory management and where I learned how to work at small, early stage companies and
    learned crucial PM skills like being the voice of customer, gathering product requirements and pain points, ideating
    them into mockups for features, copywriting, bug testing, and a <a class='pashi' target="_blank"
      href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0SJILOflIG6mXQ1ydFMIS6">lot of product marketing</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When not being a PM, I help my wife build her home-decor & remodelling business, <a class='sd' target="_blank"
      href="https://instagram.com/studio_dharaesque">studio dharaesque</a> with copywriting and operational matters, and
    taking (not enough) photos.

  <!-- <p>I love fiction as well as fine art (like sketching and sculpting) so I decided to combine those two! In this highly
    irregular newsletter, I write fiction stories and sculpt the main protagonist in ink or clay at
    <a class='substack' id='btn' target="_blank" href="https://sculptastory.substack.com">Sculpt-a-Story on
      Substack</a>.

  <p>I love reading and writing. <a href="/read.html">Here</a> are the books I like. To learn how to write better and most importantly, to edit, I started a blog <a href="/blog.html">here</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Other hobbies include clay sculpting, gardening and coding. Hopefully I can share more on that later.
