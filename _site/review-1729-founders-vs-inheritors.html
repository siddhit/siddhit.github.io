      <h2 class="">A review of 1729.com's Founding vs Inheriting post</h2>
      <p>I've been blown away with all the ideas Balaji proposes, not because I agree with them, but because I did not bother to think it could be this way. And I think that is healthier than pretending something is not exciting only because you think it disturbs some paradigm.</p>

<p>With '<a href="https://1729.com/founding-vs-inheriting/">Founding vs Inheriting</a>', I see something similar. I am myself a third-generation business family inheritor and I've been seen as lucky and unlucky at the same time. When you inherit an empire like Reliance Industries (and here, readers should note I'm from India, but moved to the US in 2014), you're considered lucky, and if you inherited a bunch of old-fashioned businesses in dying fields, not so much. But what it does, and it certainly is true of me, is that it allowed me to leave and start over.
 </p>

<p> Migrating to the US was, is, and will remain a privilege but as Balaji says, I was no longer read-only. Not being a director's son and ordering chai or spending time on the factory floor at Ford Motor Company with college kids pushing pallets and yelling with UAW workers? The latter, if I want to build from scratch. And even though I haven't found anything, I'm not inheriting.</p>

<p>With 'stock and flow', I cannot help but express whole-hearted agreement. I'm from manufacturing and have been all my life and the way it is treated in the US, we will forget it as legacy companies stop innovating. It will be as simple as saying 'oh, our work is handled by Foxconn' and that's fine but one day, we'll be left wondering when the last founder of a manufacturing company just gave up and any society, not just the US, is in perilous dependence of another society whose policies may not be in agreement with theirs. Elon Musk has brought physical startups back in vogue, with <a href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/why-vertical-integration-made-tesla-more-powerful-8b33b6aee773">vertical innovation</a> akin to Henry Ford's building of rubber plantations for the sake of securing tire supply. Such energy is lacking in inheritors and I've seen it first-hand. I don't see it as unnatural, though. If you are a founder who went from rags to riches and you have children, you'd be mistaken to think they'd have the same hunger for founding as you. We have to develop a founder mentality even more vigorously in those who have inherited wealth or power. If done correctly, it makes inheritor founders even better than both.</p>

<p>With the COVID era, we certainly have the West Coast companies to thank for giving us our services as needed and making meetings and celebrations possible and even enjoyable despite lockdowns. So thank you Amazon, Google, Zoom, Doordash for your energy and ingenuity! This, however, is where my disagreement comes in. Balaji erroneously, though unwittingly, compares at the same level things that remain on the internet - code for convenience and information - to things that are extremely physical, messy, and un-Zoom-able - making toilet paper, cars, masks. The military failed and the fire department failed. True, but comparing teams that innovate via code to teams that innovate via metal and shopfloors is looking at the world with glasses that convert atoms into bits. I would like people, especially in the West Coast, to remember it was Ford, the old, inherited legacy company that <a href="https://youtu.be/lYHgV2u1T2Y">uncomplainingly sprang into action</a> to make masks, ventilators, and shields, 10x-ing the productivity of the OEMs themselves while others were commeting on Twitter while hiding in their homes. Ford did not fail. My neighbor, who works for an essential industry (nameplate etching) never had WFH. He didn't fail even though the company was not a West Coast startup and it doesn't deal with code and it may probably be old-fashioned. Somehow, the West Coast is unwilling to venture into this territory. Everything in the world is not code, every small business is not a 'startup' (and shouldn't be), every product is not software. If you aren't allowed to move outside your home and your innovation itself is physical, are they failures? You help them succeed using software but I don't see this happening. I don't see "It's time to build" in the messy parts of the economy. Sorry Balaji, but the West Coast has miserably failed there (except Musk) despite the money, talent, and a founder mentality.</p>

<p>In essence, I agree with the comparison. I say this with confidence because I've had to reset my brain by unlearing 28 years of how to work while in a small family business and then re-learn new things in a legacy inheritance company and now, working in a <a href="https://pashi.com">SaaS startup (YC '20)</a> that helps automate manufacturing (a dirty, messy problem West Coasters don't prefer much), I think I have seen both types of groups. All in all, a good reminder to the world, and especially the US, that someone, somewhere is working hard to solve a problem and if all you have is inheritance, they will outperform you.</p>
