    <h1>Reading</h1>

    <p>Here are the books I enjoyed the most. All links are from Amazon (I've chosen the Kindle
    versions and I don't get any commission).
</p>

<h2 id="indian-stories">Indian Stories</h2>
<p>The books that got me started on reading and others from high-school literature. To jump to
    English recommendations, <a href="#fiction">click here</a></p>
<p><strong> <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Amar-Chitra-Katha-Mythology-Collection/dp/8184820712/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=amar+chitra+katha&qid=1622251777&sr=8-1">Amar
            Chitra Katha</a></strong>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anant_Pai">Anant Pai</a></p>
<p>For being the reading staple for so many kids in India, Anant Pai, or "Uncle Pai" was like Disney but better. These comics weren't animation but graphic novels and I could make the jump to actual books, and 
    taught great values.</p>

<br>
<p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/TheMahabharata_201707">The Mahabharat</a></strong>, by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyasa">Ved Vyas</a>
</p>
<p>For being the mother of all stories, 'the longest poem ever written' drives my core philosophy even
    today. <br>
    <br>
    The reasons why this epic holds on its own: its focus on how every large family eventually faces breakdown, its
    plain acceptance that
    life is suffering, its candid description of how even gods cheat when the wrong people must be prevented from
    assuming absolute power, and its bitter-but-true recommendation of why only detachment from victory and defeat, good
    and evil, love and fear will give you what you truly want - peace. There is
    hardly any completely white or black character. The depth of those characters, the
    complexity of their interwoven lives, the twisted turn of events, and above all,
    its chief message of complete surrender to one of <a target="_blank"
        href="https://web.csulb.edu/~wweinste/yogas.html">four paths to
        the truth</a> from its core - the Bhagavad Gita (which I strive to read) - has retained the freshness of its
    appeal longer (around 30 centuries) than any fiction or non-fiction book in existence.
</p>

<p><strong>Several Gujarati stories</strong> by <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhumketu_(writer)">Gaurishankar
        'Dhumketu' Joshi</a> (whose one work I translated and adapted <a target="_blank"

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunilal_Madia#Works">Chunnilal Madiya</a>.
<p>For their pained but humorous portrayal of real life in a poverty-stricken era of India, for teaching me what little
    I
    know about Gujarati literature and exposing me to the more creative side of an otherwise very commercial community
    of people.</p>


<h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2>
<p>
    These are fiction books not of Indian origin. I'm listing fiction first with science-fiction alternating with
    non-science fiction. I've been told
    non-fiction is where the real wisdom is. But fiction is what got me into reading and the way I see it is that every
    fiction book is just a colorful visage wrapped around a core of real first-hand
    learnings of the
    author. Plus, I've read that you should <a target="_blank"
        href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002068699761659905?s=20">read what you love until you love to read</a>
    and I say that to everyone who hasn't started reading yet.

        Rand</a>
</p>
<p>For its somewhat controversial philosophy of objectivism but also for a wonderful account of the career trajectories
    of
    two
    frenemies and the evolution of their competence.</p>

<h2 id="non-fiction">Non-fiction</h2>
<p>These are books that I see more as directives and concepts I need to follow and understand than worlds I need to imagine. I've
    listed them in terms of how much I remember them, alternating between books that help me go closer to my truth and
    ones more useful for daily life. To

            Now</a></strong>, by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle">Eckhart Tolle</a>
</p>
<p>For the best conversation-style book on why it's futile to live in anything but the present, the now. I listened to
    this book on <a target="_blank"

    myself reading it.</p>

            Franklin: An American Life</a></strong>,
    by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">Walter Isaacson</a>
</p>
<p>For bringing a more approachable version of America's Renaissance man, the original rags-to-riches story, and possibly the coolest
    American Founding Father there was. I frankly learned more about American history from this than what I learned in
    world history subjects in high school and popular media. Again, so much better on <a target="_blank"

    since it had an excellent narrator switching between voicing Franklin and the rest of the story.
