      <pre class="poetry-text">
        Is it your name, which means current or stream,
        Pervading our home with happiness as it rushes by,
        Washing my my mind of cynicism?
        What is it about you that makes me go,
        I met the most amazing girl!

        Maybe it's because you're so full of life,
        Oozing energy wherever you go,
        Because you steal the smiles of all you talk to
        Blazing a trail of admirers who rave about you
        That make me feel like the luckiest guy around?

        Or maybe because you balance every avtaar with perfect poise
        And carry yourself with a delightful mix of fun and style
        It might be all this and more but just maybe
        It's because you left everything to be with me
        And made me someone I could never have become alone.
