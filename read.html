<p>This got me into reading so I'll start here. I've been told non-fiction is where the real wisdom is but the way I see
    it every fiction book is just a colorful visage wrapped around a core of first-hand learnings of the author. But
    I'll leave it at that. For non-fiction, scroll below. All links are from Amazon (and I've chosen the Kindle
    versions) and I don't get a cut.</p>

            Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>, by Douglas Adams</strong> - for the best combination
    of wisdom with nonsense and satire with silliness I have seen in a science fiction book.</p>
