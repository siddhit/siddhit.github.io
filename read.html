  Here are the books I enjoyed the most. All links are from Amazon (I've chosen
  the Kindle versions and I don't get any commission).

        For being the reading staple for so many kids in India, Anant Pai, or "Uncle
        Pai" published wonderful stories spanning Indian history and mythology. These were graphic
        novels from which I could make the jump to actual books, and taught great values.

        The nuanced nature of its characters, their interwoven relationships and how well each character's life arc seeks to explain situations one might face in our own lives while also nestling in its center one of the most beautiful pieces of spiritual writing, the <a href="https://bhagavad-gita.org/index-english.html">Bhagavad Gita</a>.

        of India, for teaching me what little I know about Gujarati literature and
        exposing me to the more creative side of an otherwise very commercial
        community of people.

        These are fiction books not of Indian origin. I'm listing fiction first with
        science-fiction alternating with non-science fiction. I've been told
        non-fiction is where the real wisdom is. But fiction is what got me into
        reading and the way I see it is that every fiction book is just a colorful
        visage wrapped around a core of real first-hand learnings of the author. Plus,
        I've read that you should

        These are books that I see more as directives and concepts I need to follow
        and understand than worlds I need to imagine. I've listed them in terms of how
        much I remember them, alternating between books that help me go closer to my
        truth and ones more useful for daily life. To jump back to fiction

        For bringing a more approachable version of America's Renaissance man, the
        original rags-to-riches story, and possibly the coolest American Founding
        Father there was. I frankly learned more about American history from this than
        what I learned in world history subjects in high school and popular media.
