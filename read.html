<p>Here are the books I enjoyed the most. I'm listing fiction first since it got me into reading. I've been told
    non-fiction is where the real wisdom is.
    The way I see it is that every fiction book is just a colorful visage wrapped around a core of real first-hand
    learnings of the
    author. Plus, I've read that you should <a target="_blank"

    But I'll leave it at that. For non-fiction, scroll below. All links are from Amazon (and I've chosen the Kindle
    versions) and I don't get a cut.

    two
    frenemies and the evolution of their competence.</p>
