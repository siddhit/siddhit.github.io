<p>Here are the books I enjoyed the most. All links are from Amazon (and I've chosen the Kindle
    versions) and I don't get any commission.
</p>

<h2 id="indian-stories">Indian Stories</h2>
<p>The books that got me started on reading are simple to list:</p>
<p><strong> <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Amar-Chitra-Katha-Mythology-Collection/dp/8184820712/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=amar+chitra+katha&qid=1622251777&sr=8-1">Amar
            Chitra Katha</a></strong>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anant_Pai">Anant Pai</a></p>
<p>For being the reading staple for so many kids in India, Anant Pai, or "Uncle Pai" was like Disney but better since
    these comics weren't animation but still graphic novels and I could make the jump to actual books and of course,
    taught great values.</p>

<br>
<p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/TheMahabharata_201707">The Mahabharat</a></strong>, by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyasa">Ved Vyas</a></p>
<p>For being the mother of all stories and 'the longest poem ever written' and which drives most of my philosophy even
    today. It's, of course, full of things that could be challenged with science but I don't know why the same rigor
    isn't applied to the Illiad, Odyssey, Journey to the West or any other Abrahamic story. Its plain acceptance that
    life is suffering, that detachment alone will give you peace, complexity of emotions, turn of events, and above all,
    its chief message of complete surrender to one of <a href="https://web.csulb.edu/~wweinste/yogas.html">four paths to
        the truth</a> from its core - the Bhagavad Gita (which I strive to read) - has ensured its popularity and value
    persisted longer than any fiction or non-fiction book there is.</p>

<br>
<p>Several Gujarati stories by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhumketu_(writer)">Gaurishankar
        'Dhumketu' Joshi</a> (whose work I translated and adapted <a
        href="https://sculptastory.substack.com/p/bhikhu">here</a>), and <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunilal_Madia#Works">Chunnilal Madiya</a>.
<p>For their sublime and pained portrayal of real life in a poverty-stricken era of India, teaching me what little I
    know about Gujarati literature and exposing me to the more intellectual side of a very unartistic and commercial
    community of people.</p>


<h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2>
<p>
    These are fiction books not of Indian origin. I'm listing fiction first with science-fiction alternately with
    non-science-fiction. I've been told
    non-fiction is where the real wisdom is. But fiction is what got me into reading and the way I see it is that every
    fiction book is just a colorful visage wrapped around a core of real first-hand
    learnings of the
    author. Plus, I've read that you should <a target="_blank"
        href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002068699761659905?s=20">read what you love until you love to read</a>
    and I'll say that to everyone I can.

            Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></strong>, by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a>
</p>
<p>For the best combination
    of wisdom with nonsense and satire with silliness I have seen in a science fiction book.</p>

<p><strong> <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Kill-Mockingbird-Harperperennial-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B00K0OI42W/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">To

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Lee">Harper Lee</a>
</p>
<p>For a story of empathy in which events of terrible injustice are seen through the gentle eyes of a child and her
    relationship with her father.</p>

<p><strong> <a target="_blank"

            Fountainhead</a></strong>, by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Lee">Ayn
        Rand</a>
</p>
<p>For its somewhat controversial philosophy of objectivism but also for a wonderful account of the career trajectories
    of
    two
    frenemies and the evolution of their competence.</p>

</p>
<p>For showing how decision making can last not just a few decades but across planet systems and millenia. And also for

<h2 id="non-fiction">Non-fiction</h2>
<p>These are books that I see more as directives and concepts I need to understand than worlds I need to imagine. I've
    listed them in terms of how much I remember them, alternating between books that help me go closer to my truth and
    others. To

<p><strong> <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002361MLA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">The Power of
            Now</a></strong>, by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle">Echkart Tolle</a>
</p>
<p>For the best conversation-style book on why it's futile to live in anything but the present, the now. I listened to
    this book on <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Power-of-Now-Eckhart-Tolle-audiobook/dp/B00005AAPL/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">Audible</a>
    and I don't regret not reading it because I remember Eckart's gentle voice much better than I would have remembered
    myself reading it.</p>

            Franklin: An American Life</a></strong>,
    by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">Walter Isaacson</a>
</p>
<p>For bringing a more approachable version of America's Renaissance man, rags-to-riches story and possibly the coolest
    American Founding Father there was. I frankly learned more about American history from this than what I learned in
    world history subjects in high school and popular media. Again, so much better on <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-An-American-Life/dp/B004VLETYM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MLY82PQYDN6D&dchild=1&keywords=benjamin+franklin&qid=1622251552&s=audible&sprefix=benjamin+%2Caudible%2C184&sr=1-1">Audible</a>
    since it had an excellent narrator switching between voicing Franklin and the story.

<p>For the manufacturing guy in me. A way to see solve problems by identifying bottlenecks and applying small,
    common-sense improvements with clarity.
